How it'll work:
*run code
*socket connection is established
*code asks if user wants to send file or request file
------------- if user wants to send file -------------
*code opens file dialog
*file is chosen
*file is turned to binary
------------- if user wants to recv file -------------
*code asks for file name
*code asks if transfer should be reliable or unreliable
------------------------------------------------------
*binary padding is added to information that needs padding: source and destination ports, packet number, total packets number,acknowledged data (if transfer is reliable), data offset, window, and checksum.
